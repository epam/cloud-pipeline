| 4 | Open the just launched pipeline | |
| 5 | Click the **Instance** section to expand | **Instance** section doesn't contain the row `Node image: ...` |
| 6 | Open the "**Cluster state**" page | Nodes list contains: <li> the row for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case |
| 7 | Save the node name for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case | |
| 8 | Wait until the row for the pipeline launched at step 3 appears in the list | Nodes list contains: <li> the row for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case <li> the row for the pipeline created at step 4 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case |
| 9 | Click the run ID label in the row for the pipeline launched at step 3 | |
