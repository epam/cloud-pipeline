  'ResizeObjects': `
__ResizeObjects__ will upsize or downsize an objectâ€™s label matrix by a factor or by specifying the final dimensions in pixels. ResizeObjects uses nearest neighbor interpolation to preserve object labels after the resizing operation.

When resizing 3D data, the height and width will be changed, but the original depth (or z-dimension) will be kept. This 3D behavior was chosen, because in most cases the number of slices in a z-stack is much fewer than the number of pixels that define the x-y dimensions. Otherwise, a significant fraction of z information would be lost during downsizing. __ResizeObjects__ is useful for processing very large or 3D data to reduce computation time. You might downsize a 3D image with __ResizeImage__ to generate a segmentation, then use __ResizeObjects__ to stretch the segmented objects to their original size before computing measurements with the original 3D image. __ResizeObjects__ differs from __ExpandOrShrinkObjects__ and __ShrinkToObjectCenters__ in that the overall dimensions of the object label matrix, or image, are changed. In contrast, __ExpandOrShrinkObjects__ will alter the size of the objects within an image, but it will not change the size of the image itself.`
