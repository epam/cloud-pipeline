  'RescaleIntensity': `
__RescaleIntensity__ changes the intensity range of an image to your desired specifications.

This module lets you rescale the intensity of the input images by any of several methods. You should use caution when interpreting intensity and texture measurements derived from images that have been rescaled because certain options for this module do not preserve the relative intensities from image to image.  

As this module rescales data it will not attempt to normalize displayed previews (as this could make it appear that the scaling had done nothing). As a result images rescaled to large ranges may appear dim after scaling.

Supports 2D? YES
