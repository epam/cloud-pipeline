# Check running instances restriction applied to Group

Test verified that the restriction of the running instances count specified for a user group
- is applied to each user of that group
- has higher priority than global restriction

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Non-admin user is a member of `<User_Group1>`
- Perform [2642_1](2642_1.md) case

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Settings** page | |
| 3 | Open the **USER MANAGEMENT** tab | |
| 4 | Click the **Groups** tab | |
| 5 | Find `User_Group` group and open it to edit | | 
| 6 | In the *Launch options* section input value `<limit2>` into the *Allowed instances count* field. `<limit2>` should be less than `<limit1>` from the [2642_1](2642_1.md) case | |
| 7 | Click **OK** button | |
| 8 | Logout | |
| 9 | Login as the non-admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 10 | Open the **Tools** page | |
| 11 | Select the test tool | |
| 12 | Launch a tool with default settings | |
| 13 | Repeat steps 10-12 several times to launch `<limit2>` runs| |
| 14 | Select the test tool | |
| 15 | Launch a tool with default settings | Error message `Launch of new jobs is restricted as [<non-admin user>] user will exceed [<User_Group1>] runs limit [<limit2>]` appears, where <br> `<non-admin user>` is the non-admin user from the prerequisites, <br> `<limit2>` is the value specified at step 6 |
| 16 | Repeat steps 1-15 for case `<limit2>` more than `<limit1>` from the [2642_1](2642_1.md) case | <li> Global restriction isn't applied <li> Error message `Launch of new jobs is restricted as [<non-admin user>] user will exceed [<User_Group1>] runs limit [<limit2>]` appears at attempt to launch `<limit2> + 1` run |

**After:**
- Stop runs launched in case
