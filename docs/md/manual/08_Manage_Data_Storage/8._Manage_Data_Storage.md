> Permissions management for a storage is described [here](../13_Permissions/13._Permissions.md).

**"Details view"** lists content of the storage: files that may be organized into folders. Clicking on the inside folder will open its content in the **"Details view"**.  
**_Note_**: storage's folders hierarchy will not be represented in the **"Hierarchy view"** panel.  
**_Note_**: you can move **Storage** to a new parent folder using drag and drop approach.

In **"Library tree view"** and **"Details view"** data storages are tagged with region flag to visually distinguish storage locations.

> **_Note_**: if a specific platform deployment has a number of Cloud Providers registered (e.g. `AWS`+`Azure`, `GCP`+`Azure`) - in that case auxiliary Cloud Provider icons are additionally displayed, e.g.:

Another option for navigation in the storage is to use ["breadcrumbs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)) control at the top of the **"Details"** view (see picture above, **1**):

- Clicking an item will navigate to that folder.

- Editing a path will allow to copy/paste a path and navigate to any custom location.

## Controls

At the top of the **"Details"** view there are buttons:

### Select page

Clicking this control (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **2**), the whole file and folders on the current page will be selected. It allows to perform bulk operations like deleting.

### Show file versions

> This feature is available not for all Cloud Providers. Currently, it is supported by **AWS** and **GCP**.

Tick this checkbox (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **3**) and the view of a page will changed: the all file versions will be displayed. You can expand each version's list by clicking "**+**" in desired line.  
**_Note_**: the last version will be marked by "**(latest)**".

### Remove all selected

This is a bulk operation control. It is visible, if at least one of the data storage item (folder or file) is selected.

### Generate URL

This control helps to generate URLs for a number of files and then download them manually one by one or via scripts. See details [here](8.2._Upload_Download_data.md).  
**_Note_**: the control is available, if only files are selected.

### Show attributes/Hide attributes

Allows see or edit a list of **key=value** attributes of the data storage (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **4**).  
**_Note_**: If selected storage has any defined attribute, **Attributes** pane is shown by default. See [17. CP objects tagging by additional attributes](../17_Tagging_by_attributes/17._CP_objects_tagging_by_additional_attributes.md).

### "Gear" icon

Allows to edit the path, alias, description of the storage, manage its STS and LTS and enable versions control (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **5**). The delete option is also here (if storage contains only metadata, it will be deleted anyway). See [8.1. Create and edit storage](8.1._Create_and_edit_storage.md).

### Refresh

Allows updating representation of storage's contents (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **6**).

### + Create

You can also create new folders and files via this button (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **7**). See [8.3. Create and Edit text files](8.3._Create_and_Edit_text_files.md).

### Upload

This control allows uploading files to the storage (see picture **Figure 1** above, item **8**). See [8.2. Upload/Download data](8.2._Upload_Download_data.md).

### Each-line controls

## CLI Storage options

There are also several options that are only implemented in CLI but not in GUI:

- To move files and folders from one storage to another or between local file system and storage.
- To copy files from one storage to another.

See [here](../14_CLI/14.3._Manage_Storage_via_CLI.md) for more details.
