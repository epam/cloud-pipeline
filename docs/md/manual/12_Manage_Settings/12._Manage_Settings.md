## CLI tab

"**CLI**" tab generates two types of CLI installation and configuration commands to set CLI for the Cloud Pipeline - **Pipe CLI** and **Git CLI**. You can select each of them by click the corresponding option in the "**CLI**" tab menu.

### Pipe CLI

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_1.png)

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Operation system** | Choose an operation system from drop-down list and the instruction how to install the Cloud Pipeline CLI will appear in the window below. |
| **Generate access key** | Generates access token to be used by CLI. |
| **Valid till** | A date access key expires. |

For more details see [14.1. Install and setup CLI](../14_CLI/14.1._Install_and_setup_CLI.md).

### Git CLI

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_10.png)

Here you can see instructions how to configure your Git client to work with the Cloud Pipeline.

## System events

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

**System events** tab represents system events notifications. Here you can create, edit, delete system events notifications.  
System events notifications are organized into a table. It represents the **body of the notification**, its **severity status** ("_info_", "_warning_" or "_critical_") and **date of creation**, **activity status**.  
**_Note_**: Variants of activity status:

- **Blocking** event emerges in the middle of the window and requires confirmation from the user to disappear.
- **Active** notifications will be shown for all users of the Cloud Pipeline until admin sets them inactive.

Administrator can **edit** and **delete** notifications via corresponding buttons.

### System events controls

Controls are at the top right of the table.

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Expand/Collapse** | This button (**1**) shows/hides the body of the event. |
| **Refresh** | To refresh a list of notifications press this control (**2**). |
| **+ ADD** | This control (**3**) allows to create new notification. |
| **Edit** | The control (**4**) opens the edit form of the event. |
| **Delete** | To delete an event click the control (**5**). |

## User management

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **User management** tab helps to manage user groups and system roles.

To grant or refuse permissions to a specific group of users (e.g. project team members), you can just create a user group and grant or refuse permissions to the specific set of objects to the whole group.  
System roles is one of the principal tool for managing security access to the objects. Even if you have **WRITE** permission for a folder object, you might be not able to create a pipeline there, if you don't have the **ROLE\_PIPELINE\_MANAGER** role.  
**_Note_**: About permissions, you can read more [here](../13_Permissions/13._Permissions.md).

**User management** consists of the 3 following tabs: **Users**, **Groups**, **Roles**.

### Users

This table view displays a list of users and their additional information:

- **Name** - an authenticated domain account (SAML/OAuth/OpenID), e.g. e-mail.
- **Groups** - a set of groups assigned to a user. It could be whether CP's user's groups and groups, given to each user automatically by **SSO authentication system**.  
    **_Note_**: automatically created groups based on SSO authentication system are light-grey colored.
- **Roles** - a set of system roles assigned to a user.

#### Users tab controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Search field** | To search particular user from a list of users, start to enter the user's name (see the picture below, **1**). |
| **+ Create user** | This control (see the picture below, **2**) opens a **"Create user"** form, which can be used to create a new user. |
| **Export users** | Allows export all users with selected set of attributes (see the picture below, **3**). |
| **Edit** | Allows changing a list of roles or groups assigned to a user (see the picture below, **4**). |

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_3.png)

#### Export users

The **Export users** button allows administrator to export user list in `.csv` format.  
![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_12.png)

There are 2 export options:

1. **Default configuration**  
    In this case, the file with all users and full list of their properties (**_ID_**, **_username_**, **_attributes_** (first and last name, email), **_registration date_**, **_first login date_**, list of **_groups_**, list of **_roles_**, **_blocked_**/**_unblocked_** state, **_default data storage_**) will be downloaded to the local workstation.  
    To export full user list with default configuration:  
    - click the **Export users** button in the right upper corner of the **Users** tab in the **User management** dashboard  
        ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_14.png)  
    **_or_**
    - hover the **v** button next to the **Export users** button and click the **Default configuration** item in the appeared drop-down menu  
        ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_15.png)
2. **Custom configuration**  
    Custom configuration allows admins to select which user properties should be downloaded:  
    - hover the **v** button next to the **Export users** button and click the **Custom configuration** item in the appeared drop-down menu  
        ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_16.png)  
    - the modal window with the list of available user properties to export will appear, e.g.:  
        ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_13.png)  
        User can select any set of attributes by marking/unmarking corresponding checkboxes. At least 1 checkbox should be marked to export user list.  
        _"Fields"_ section contains the list of all users' attributes (by default, all attributes are selected).  
        _"Metadata"_ section contains the list of all users' metadata attributes (by default, all attributes are deselected).  
        **_Note_**: enabled **Header** checkbox adds the headers row into the exporting file.
    - to download the result file with full user list and custom set of their properties click the **Download CSV** button.

> **_Note_**: not all user's metadata have to be exported. Some of them may contains the sensitive data. To restrict the list of the metadata to export the following system preference should be used - **`misc.metadata.sensitive.keys`**. In this preference, all metadata keys that **_shouldn't be exported_** are being specified (i.e. if these metadata keys are specified in the preference, they will not be displayed at the export pop-up for selection).

## Preferences

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **Preferences** tab contains different global settings for the Cloud Pipeline. These settings determine default behavior of the Cloud Pipeline.
On the left you can see a set of sections. Each section contains a list of global settings. See more information [here](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md).

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_9.png)

## Cloud Regions

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **Cloud Regions** tab contains different settings for the specific Cloud Regions. You could manage regions, add or remove them from the Cloud Pipeline.

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_11.png)

## System dictionaries

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **System dictionaries** tab contains the list of predefined "dictionaries" - sets of "key-value(s)" that could be used by admins when configuring **Cloud Pipeline** objects attributes (metadata).

For example, admins have to set attributes (metadata) for "general" users manually. In case, when such metadata keys aren't different for each user and has certain amount of values, it is convenient to select these values from the predefined values list, not to specify them manually each time.

Each dictionary is the categorical attribute. I.e. it is attribute which values are predefined.
Each dictionary has its name and values:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_18.png)  
If the dictionary exists in the system, then admin can use it when specifying attributes for any Platform object (**`Pipeline`**, **`Folder`**, **`Storage`**, **`Project`**, **`Tool`**), and also for **`User`**, **`Group`** or **`Role`**. In this case, it is enough to specify only the dictionary name as the attribute key, the list of dictionary values will appear automatically in the value field:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_20.png)

Also, the different dictionaries may be connected (linked). I.e. admins can create two dictionaries, which values are mapped `1-1` or `1-many`, e.g.:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_19.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_22.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_21.png)

In the GUI, such connection is being handled in the following way:

1. Admin specifies the links between the dictionaries items (e.g. for the example above _`ProjectID`:`BRCA1`_ -> _`DataStorage`:`<path>`_).
2. Links have the "autofill" attribute. If the admin selects the source key (_`ProjectID`:`BRCA1`_) as attribute key for any object - the destination key will be specified automatically (_`DataStorage`_ will be added with the _`<path>`_ selection):  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_23.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_24.png)

For more details see [here](12.13._System_dictionaries.md).

**_Note_**: all functionality described above is available only for admins. "General" users can't view/edit System Dictionaries. If non-admin user tries to specify any existing dictionary as the attribute "Key" - it will be displayed as plain text attribute. No dictionary values will be loaded/displayed.

## System logs

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **System logs** tab contains the following audit trail events:

- users' authentication attempts
- users' profiles modifications
- platform objects' permissions management
- access to interactive applications from pipeline runs
- other platform functionality features

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_17.png)
