| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the non-admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Tools** page | |

| 9 | Click the **Configure cluster** control | |
| 10 | Click the **Auto-scaled cluster** tab | |
| 11 | Set value `3` into ***Auto-scaled up to:*** field | Warning message `Your cluster configuration may exceed the maximum number of running jobs. There are 1 jobs running out of 3.` is shown on the ***Configure cluster*** pop-up |
| 12 | Click ***Setup default child nodes count*** link | | 
| 13 | Set value `2` into ***Default child nodes:*** field | Error message `You have exceeded maximum number of running jobs (3).` is shown in the ***Configure cluster*** pop-up, where `3` is the limit specified at step 6 of the Preparations |
| 14 | Set value `1` into ***Default child nodes:*** field | Warning message `Your cluster configuration may exceed the maximum number of running jobs. There are 1 jobs running out of 3.` is shown on the ***Configure cluster*** pop-up |
| 15 | Click the **OK** button | Warning message `Your cluster configuration may exceed the maximum number of running jobs. There are 1 jobs running out of 3.` is shown in the ***Exec environment*** section |
| 16 | Click **Launch** button | **Launch** pop-up that contains warning message `Your cluster configuration may exceed the maximum number of running jobs. There are 1 jobs running out of 3.` appears | 
| 17 | Click **Launch** button | |

| 19 | Wait until the label "Nested runs" appears | Only 1 child run is created |
| 20 | Wait until the **SSH** hyperlink appears | |
| 22 | Click the **SSH** hyperlink | |
| 23 | Enter and perform the command: `pipe users instances` | Response contains follow info: <li> `Active runs detected for a user: [<non-admin user>: 3]` |

**After:**
- Stop runs launched at steps 4, 17
- Remove *Allowed instance max count* values for non-admin user and test groups using in cases
- Restore the `launch.max.runs.user.global` preference value to value kept at step 6 of the [2642_1](2642_1.md) case
