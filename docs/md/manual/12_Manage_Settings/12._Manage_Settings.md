### Git CLI

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_10.png)

Here you can see instructions how to configure your Git client to work with the Cloud Pipeline.

***

## System events

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

**System events** tab represents system events notifications. Here you can create, edit, delete system events notifications.  
System events notifications are organized into a table. It represents the **body of the notification**, its **severity status** ("_info_", "_warning_" or "_critical_") and **date of creation**, **activity status**.  
**_Note_**: Variants of activity status:

- **Blocking** event emerges in the middle of the window and requires confirmation from the user to disappear.
- **Active** notifications will be shown for all users of the Cloud Pipeline until admin sets them inactive.

Administrator can **edit** and **delete** notifications via corresponding buttons.  
![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_2.png)

### System events controls

Controls are at the top right of the table.

|   | Control | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Expand/Collapse** | This button shows/hides the body of the event. |
| **2** | **Refresh** | To refresh a list of notifications. |
| **3** | **+ ADD** | To create a new notification. |
| **4** | **Edit** | To open the edit form for the event. |
| **5** | **Delete** | To delete an event. |

## User management

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role or the **_ROLE\_USER\_READER_** role.

The **User management** tab helps to manage user groups and system roles.

To grant or refuse permissions to a specific group of users (e.g. project team members), you can just create a user group and grant or refuse permissions to the specific set of objects to the whole group.  
System roles is one of the principal tool for managing security access to the objects. Even if you have **WRITE** permission for a folder object, you might be not able to create a pipeline there, if you don't have the **ROLE\_PIPELINE\_MANAGER** role.  
**_Note_**: About permissions, you can read more [here](../13_Permissions/13._Permissions.md).

**User management** consists of the following subtabs: [**Users**](#users), [**Groups**](#groups), [**Roles**](#roles), [**Usage report**](#usage-report).

### Users

This table view displays a list of users and their additional information:

- **Name** - an authenticated domain account (SAML/OAuth/OpenID), e.g. e-mail.
- **Groups** - a set of groups assigned to a user. It could be whether CP's user's groups and groups, given to each user automatically by **SSO authentication system**.  
    **_Note_**: automatically created groups based on SSO authentication system are light-grey colored.
- **Roles** - a set of system roles assigned to a user.

Additionally, near the name user's state is shown. Possible states:

- _Online_ - for users who are logged in and use the Platform in the moment  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_31.png)
- _Offline_ - for users who are not logged in at the moment/do not use the Platform for some time  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_32.png)

By hover over the _Offline_ icons - the tooltip will be shown that contains the info when the specific user has utilized the Platform the last time, e.g.:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_33.png)

> Please note, that users' states are visible only for user with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

## Preferences

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

The **Preferences** tab contains different global settings for the Cloud Pipeline. These settings determine default behavior of the Cloud Pipeline.  
On the left you can see a set of sections. Each section contains a list of global settings. See more information [here](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md).

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_9.png)

***

## Cloud Regions

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

The **Cloud Regions** tab contains different settings for the specific Cloud Regions and Cloud Providers.  
You could manage regions, add or remove them from the Cloud Pipeline.

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_11.png)

***

## System dictionaries

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

The **System dictionaries** tab contains the list of predefined "dictionaries" - sets of "key-value(s)" that could be used by admins when configuring **Cloud Pipeline** objects attributes (metadata).

For example, admins have to set attributes (metadata) for "general" users manually. In case, when such metadata keys aren't different for each user and has certain amount of values, it is convenient to select these values from the predefined values list, not to specify them manually each time.

Each dictionary is the categorical attribute. I.e. it is attribute which values are predefined.
Each dictionary has its name and values:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_18.png)  
If the dictionary exists in the system, then admin can use it when specifying attributes for any Platform object (**`Pipeline`**, **`Folder`**, **`Storage`**, **`Project`**, **`Tool`**), and also for **`User`**, **`Group`** or **`Role`**. In this case, it is enough to specify only the dictionary name as the attribute key, the list of dictionary values will appear automatically in the value field:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_20.png)

Also, the different dictionaries may be connected (linked). I.e. admins can create two dictionaries, which values are mapped `1-1` or `1-many`, e.g.:  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_19.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_22.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_21.png)

In the GUI, such connection is being handled in the following way:

1. Admin specifies the links between the dictionaries items (e.g. for the example above _`ProjectID`:`BRCA1`_ -> _`DataStorage`:`<path>`_).
2. Links have the "autofill" attribute. If the admin selects the source key (_`ProjectID`:`BRCA1`_) as attribute key for any object - the destination key will be specified automatically (_`DataStorage`_ will be added with the _`<path>`_ selection):  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_23.png)  
    ![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_24.png)

For more details see [here](12.13._System_dictionaries.md).

**_Note_**: all functionality described above is available only for admins. "General" users can't view/edit System Dictionaries. If non-admin user tries to specify any existing dictionary as the attribute "Key" - it will be displayed as plain text attribute. No dictionary values will be loaded/displayed.

***

## System management

> This tab is visible only for users with the **_ROLE\_ADMIN_** role.

The **System management** tab includes several possibilities to configure/observe the Platform deployment in general.

### System logs

The **System logs** subtab contains the following audit trail events:

- users' authentication attempts
- users' profiles modifications
- platform objects' permissions management
- access to interactive applications from pipeline runs
- access to the data stored in the object storages
- management of the transition rules for [storages lifecycle](../08_Manage_Data_Storage/8.10._Storage_lifecycle.md)
- other platform functionality features

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_17.png)

For more details see [here](12.12._System_logs.md).

### NAT gateway

The **NAT gateway** subtab allows to configure network routes.  
This is nessasary when the Cloud Pipeline Platform is deployed in some private subnet and the admin needs to expose a network endpoint for some service.  
Via this form, admins can create/remove network routes from private subnet(s) to the external network resources.

The **NAT gateway** subtab contains:

- the list of existing routes (port forwarding map). Each route record contains:
    - info about external resources
    - info about corresponding internal config (mapping details)
    - comment
- controls to manage the routes list (add/remove/save etc.)

![CP_ManageSettings](attachments/ManageSettings_26.png)
