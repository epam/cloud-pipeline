**_Note_**: If any exceptions occur during installation, follow the instructions in the Terminal.  
Notice that Python 2 / Python 3 has to be installed to run CLI. Python can be downloaded here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.  
**_Note_**: **pip** package manager is required for CLI installation if you selected **Operation System** → **Other** on step 2. Modern **Python** versions come bundled with **pip**. On top of that, with this type of installation you'll also need internet connection to install dependencies.

## `pipe` configuration for using NTLM Authentication Proxy

CLI `pipe` can be configured for using NTLM Authentication Proxy, when running in Linux.

For that, use the following options while execute `pipe configure` command:

- `-nt` or `--proxy-ntlm` - enables NTLM proxy support
- `-nu` or `--proxy-ntlm-user` - sets username for NTLM proxy authorization
- `-np` or `--proxy-ntlm-pass` - sets password for NTLM proxy authorization
- `-nd` or `--proxy-ntlm-domain` - sets domain for NTLM proxy authorization

If `pipe configure` command is executing with specified `--proxy-ntlm` option, `pipe` will try to get the proxy value from the `--proxy` option or the environment variables (`--proxy` option has a higher priority).  
Example:

```bash
pipe configure --proxy-ntlm --proxy "http://myproxy:3128"
```

As you can see, if some of the `configure` options are not set directly in command, you will be prompted to specify them in an interactive manner.
