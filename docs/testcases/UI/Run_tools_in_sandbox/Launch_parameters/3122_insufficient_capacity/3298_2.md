**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Perform [3122_1](3122_1.md) case
- Node type `type1` of rare compute instance type for the current Cloud Provider which launch attempt can lead to the exception of insufficient capacity of such node types for the Cloud Region

**Preparations**
1. Login as admin user from the prerequisites
2. Open the **Settings** page
3. Click the **PREFERENCES** tab
4. Find the **`run.reschedule.enabled`** preference
5. Uncheck *Enabled* checkbox for `run.reschedule.enabled` preference if needed
6. Click **Save** button if needed

| 15 | Launch the run | |
| 16 | At the **Runs** page, click the just-launched run | |
| 17 | Wait until ***RestartPipelineRun*** task appears | <li> Run is stopped <li> Message `Server failure reason: Insufficient instance capacity.` appears under the run title |
| 18 | Wait until ***RestartPipelineRun*** task appears | <li> Run is stopped <li> Message `Server failure reason: Insufficient instance capacity.` appears under the run title <li> Message `The following run was launched instead of current one: <restarted_runID> <region2>` with link appears |
| 19 | Click ***RestartPipelineRun*** task | Records `Run '<runID>' failed to start. <br> A new run '<restarted_runID>' started in a region '<region2>'.` are shown in the log |
| 20 | Click on the `<restarted_runID>` in the `The following run was launched instead of current one` message | Restarted Run Log page opens that contains message `This run was launched instead of: <runID> <region1>` with link, where <runID> is ID of run launched at step 15 |
| 21 | Wait until ***RestartPipelineRun*** task appears | <li> Run is stopped <li> Message `Server failure reason: Insufficient instance capacity.` appears under the run title |
| 22 | Click ***RestartPipelineRun*** task | Records <br> `Run '<restarted_runID>' failed to start.` <br> `Cannot restart run '<restarted_runID>': no next region available.` <br> are shown in the log |
| 23 | Click on the `<runID>` in the `This run was launched instead of` message | |
| 24 | Click ***RestartPipelineRun*** task | Records <br> `Run '<restarted_runID>' failed to start.` <br> `Cannot restart run '<restarted_runID>': no next region available.` <br> are shown in the log |

**After:**
- Restore the value of the `run.reschedule.enabled` preference to the previous value saved at step 12 of the preparations of [3122_1](3122_1.md) case
- Restore the value of the option _Allow reschedule to different region in case of insufficient capacity_ that was in place before step 6
