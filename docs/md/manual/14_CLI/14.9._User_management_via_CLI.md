# 14.9. User management via CLI

- [Batch import](#batch-import)

> Cloud Pipeline CLI has to be installed. See [14. Command-line interface (CLI)](14._Command-line_interface.md).

## Batch import

`pipe` CLI offers the same options to import the users from a `CSV` file as it can be performed via [GUI](../12_Manage_Settings/12.3._Create_a_new_user.md#users-batch-import).

Command to import users from `CSV` file:

``` bash
pipe users import [OPTIONS] FILE_PATH
```

Where **FILE_PATH** - defines a path to the `CSV` file with users list

Possible options:

| Options | Description |
|---|---|
| **Non-required options** |
| `-cu` / `--create-user` | Allows new user creation |
| `-cg` / `--create-group` | Allows new group creation |
| `-cm` / `--create-metadata` `<KEY>` | Allows to create a new metadata with specified key. Multiple options supported |

To mimic the GUI scenario, described [here](../12_Manage_Settings/12.3._Create_a_new_user.md#import-users), the following command will be used (it imports an [example CSV](../12_Manage_Settings/12.3._Create_a_new_user.md#example-csv) and allows creation of any object, that does not exist yet):

``` bash
pipe users import   --create-user \
                    --create-group \
                    --create-metadata billing-center \
                    --create-metadata import_attr1 \
                    ~/import-test.csv
```

During the execution - `pipe` command prints detailed logs, regarding the operations, which were performed and how the `CSV` was parsed:

``` bash
[INFO] User 'IMPORT_USER1' successfully created.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP1' successfully created.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP1' successfully assigned to user 'IMPORT_USER1'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-center'='Center1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER1'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-group'='Group1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER1'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'import_attr1'='import_attr1_val1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER1'.
[INFO] User 'IMPORT_USER2' successfully created.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP2' successfully created.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP2' successfully assigned to user 'IMPORT_USER2'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-center'='Center1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER2'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-group'='Group1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER2'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'import_attr1'='import_attr1_val2' added to user 'IMPORT_USER2'.
[INFO] User 'IMPORT_USER3' successfully created.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP1' successfully assigned to user 'IMPORT_USER3'.
[INFO] Role 'ROLE_IMPORT_GROUP2' successfully assigned to user 'IMPORT_USER3'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-center'='Center2' added to user 'IMPORT_USER3'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'billing-group'='Group1' added to user 'IMPORT_USER3'.
[INFO] A new metadata 'import_attr1'='import_attr1_val3' added to user 'IMPORT_USER3'.
```

To view results see [here](../12_Manage_Settings/12.3._Create_a_new_user.md#import-results-review). They will be the same as on GUI.
