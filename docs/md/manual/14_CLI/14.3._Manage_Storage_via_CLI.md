> Cloud Pipeline CLI has to be installed. See [14.1. Install and setup CLI](14.1._Install_and_setup_CLI.md).

## Create a data storage

``` bash
pipe storage create [OPTIONS]
```

In the example below data storage "**my-personal-storage1**" for bucket "**my-personal-bucket1**" is created in the "**ROOT**" folder. **`-c`** flag is to create a bucket in the cloud.  
**_Note_**: **"Description"**, **"STS"**, **"LTS"**, **"Backup time"** and **"Type of the cloud for data storage"** fields are left empty. That means that their values will be default.

``` bash
pipe storage create -p my-personal-bucket1 -n my-personal-storage1 -c -f ROOT
```

## Delete a data storage

``` bash
pipe storage delete [OPTIONS]
```

In the example below we delete the "**my-personal-bucket1**" storage.

``` bash
pipe storage delete -n my-personal-bucket1
```

## Create a folder in a storage

Create a folder in a data storage with the following:

``` bash
pipe storage mkdir [OPTIONS] FOLDERS...
```

In the example below we will create the folder "**new-folder**" in the data storage "**my-personal-bucket2**".

``` bash
pipe storage mkdir cp://my-personal-bucket2/new-folder
```

## Upload and download data

Command to upload/download data:

``` bash
pipe storage cp [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION
```

Examples below demonstrate how to upload/download data and check the results:

``` bash
# 1. Recursively copy a folder from a local system to S3 bucket (Upload the data).
pipe storage cp ~/data cp://input-data/ --recursive
# Application will start uploading files and print progress
# Output will be similiar to this:
#  [##############################]  100%  1.fastq  3/3 b
#  [##############################]  100%  2.fastq  4/4 b
# 2. Check that data is uploaded - list cloud storage
pipe storage ls cp://input-data --recursive
# Listing output will be similiar to this:
#  Type    Labels      Modified               Size    Name
#  File    STANDARD    2017-10-24 17:39:37       3    1.fastq
#  File    STANDARD    2017-10-24 17:39:39       4    2.fastq
# 3. Recursively copy a folder from s3 bucket to the local system (Download the data).
pipe storage cp cp://input-data/ ~/data --recursive
```

**_Note_**: **`--recursive`** flag is not needed when you copy a single file.  
**_Note_**: Earlier CLI could not accept remote paths other than **`cp://`**. For backward compatibility **`s3://`** path is also available now and is treated in the same manner as **`cp://`**.  
**_Note_**: Files uploaded via CLI will have the following attributes and values automatically set:

- **CP\_OWNER**. The value of the attribute will be set as a user ID.
- **CP\_SOURCE**. The value of the attribute will be set as a local path used to upload.

The example below demonstrates automatic file tagging after data uploading to the bucket **`s3://my-personal-bucket2/`**:

``` bash
pipe storage cp tagged-file s3://my-personal-bucket2/
```

``` bash
pipe storage get-object-tags s3://my-personal-bucket2/tagged-file
```

## Control File versions

### Show files versions

Command to view storage contents:

``` bash
pipe storage ls [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

In the examples below we check the contents of the data storage.
Flag **`-l`** is used to show file details:

``` bash
pipe storage ls cp://my-versioning-test -l
```

![CP_ManageStorageViaCLI](attachments/ManageStorageViaCLI_06.png)

``` bash
pipe storage ls cp://my-versioning-test -l -v
```

**`-v`** flag is used to view storage contents. It is available for users with **ROLE\_ADMIN** or **OWNER** properties.  
**_Note_**: file "**1.txt**" has 2 versions:

![CP_ManageStorageViaCLI](attachments/ManageStorageViaCLI_07.png)

To view versions of specific file specify its name after the directory name:

``` bash
pipe storage ls cp://my-versioning-test/1.txt -l -v
```

### Restore files

Command to restore a previous version of a file:

``` bash
pipe storage restore <path to a file> -v <Version>
```

The commands below show how to check file versions, set the previous version of a file as the latest and verify that everything went fine:

``` bash
pipe storage ls cp://my-versioning-test/1.txt -l -v
pipe storage restore cp://my-versioning-test/1.txt -v <Version>
pipe storage ls cp://my-versioning-test/1.txt -l -v
```

![CP_ManageStorageViaCLI](attachments/ManageStorageViaCLI_09.png)

**_Note_**: When a specified version of the "**1.txt**" is restored, a copy of that version is created to become the latest version of the file.  
You can restore a deleted file without specifying a version. It works only for files with a "**Delete marker**" as the latest version ("**1.txt**" in the example below):

``` bash
pipe storage restore cp://my-versioning-test/1.txt
```

![CP_ManageStorageViaCLI](attachments/ManageStorageViaCLI_10.png)  
**_Note_**: Before we restored the file "**1.txt**" its latest version was a "**Delete marker**". After restoration, it disappeared.

### Delete an object from a data storage

Command to set a "**Delete marker**":

``` bash
pipe storage rm <path to a file>
```

**_Note_**: the object will remain in a data storage and be available for **`pipe storage restore`** command.  
In the example below we set a "**Delete marker**" to the file "**2.txt**":

``` bash
pipe storage rm cp://my-versioning-test/2.txt
```

![CP_ManageStorageViaCLI](attachments/ManageStorageViaCLI_11.png)  
**_Note_**: the latest version of the file "**2.txt**" is marked with "**Delete marker**" now.  
To completely delete an object from a data storage use **`-d (--hard-delete)`** option.

### Change backup duration, select STS/LTS duration, enable versioning

Command to change backup duration, select STS/LTS duration or enable versioning:

``` bash
pipe storage policy [OPTIONS]
```

In the example below backup duration (**`-b`**) is set to 25 days, STS (**`-sts`**) and LTS (**`-lts`**) durations are set to 50 days and 100 days respectively for the data storage "**my-versioning-test**". Also, we enable versioning (**`-v`**) for that data storage:

``` bash
pipe storage policy -n my-versioning-test -b 25 -sts 50 -lts 100 -v
```
