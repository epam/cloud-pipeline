# Check running instances restriction applied to User

Test verifies
- that the restriction of the running instances count specified for a user has higher priority than Group restriction
- that Paused run can't be resumed if user exceed limit of running instances
- that Stopped run can't be reruned if user exceed limit of running instances
- command `pipe users instances --verbose` response all running instances restrictions specified for the current
 user

3. Stop run launched at step 13 of [2642_3](2642_3.md) case
4. Click **Pause** link for run launched at step 15 of [2642_3](2642_3.md)
