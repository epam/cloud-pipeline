# JavaScript implementation

The JavaScript example implementation of the [Usage scenario](API_tutorials.md) offers a Web form, that allows to specify the job input parameters and submit it into the Cloud Pipeline via the API.

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS 10.15.3+
* npm 6.4.1+

## Setup the configuration

Locate the JavaScript sample application at [js_example](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/tree/develop/docs/md/api/API_tutorials/attachments/js_example) or clone it from the Cloud Pipeline repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline
cd cloud-pipeline/docs/md/api/API_tutorials/attachments/js_example/
```

Open the configuration file [config.js](attachments/js_example/src/api/config.js) and replace the following values:

* `<host>` - set to the host of the Cloud Pipeline API
* `<storage_id>` - set to the ID of the bucket, that is going to be used as a "working directory". FASTQ files and processing results will placed into this bucket

## Start the application

```bash
# Install dependencies and start the app
# UI will be served on 0.0.0.0:3010
npm install
npm run start
```

## Application description

Once app is built and loaded in the web-browser one can perform the following operations:

* Setup the cellranger parameters
    * Set the location of the FASTQ files
    * Choose the transcriptome
    * Specify the "workdir", where the job will keep the results

* Once the job parameters are set, user can click LAUNCH and the job is submitted to the Cloud Pipeline backend via the HTTP/REST API

* Application will poll the Cloud Pipeline API until the job is finished
* Once done, application will load the cellranger's data processing summary from the job results folder and display it in the web-browser
