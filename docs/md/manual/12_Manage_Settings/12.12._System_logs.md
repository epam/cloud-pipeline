| **Log message** | Description of the log event |

| **Service** | Service name that registered the event (`api-srv`, `edge`) |
| **Type** | Log message type (currently, only `security` type is available) |

## Filters

By default, in the list all logs are displayed from new to old.  
For the more convenient search of the desired logs, there are filters over the logs list:

You may combine them in any order for your needs.

### Date filter

To restrict the list of logs for a specific date/time interval - use the **From** and **To** controls.  
For example, to view logs for all events that were today after `21:30`:

- Click the **From** control:  
    ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_2.png)  
    Click the **Select time** button
- Select the desired time (the left column for hours, middle - for minutes, right - for secs):

The following types can be here:  
    ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_10.png)

- `security` - logs related to security events - e.g. authentication in the Platform/services or access to objects (granting permissions)  
    ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_9.png)
- `audit` - logs related to any access to the data stored in the object storages. All operations (_READ_/_WRITE_/_DELETE_) excluding only listing are being logged.  
    The following sources are being logged:  
    - data access operations from the Platform GUI. These logs are accumulated from services `api-srv` or `gui`. Operations may be like these - via the GUI in an Object storage, user opened a file-preview, user created a new file, user deleted a file, etc.:  
        ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_11.png)
    - data access operations from the `pipe` CLI. These logs are accumulated from the `pipe-cli` service. Operations may be like these - via the `pipe` CLI in a console or web SSH-terminal, user opened a file content from an Object storage, user copied/moved a file to an Object storage, etc.:  
        ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_12.png)
    - data access operations performed in mounted Object storages - all Object storages that mounted via the Platform for using in runs (`~/cloud-data` folder in each run) or storages that were mounted manually by user via [`pipe storage mount`](../14_CLI/14.3._Manage_Storage_via_CLI.md#mount-a-storage) command. These logs are accumulated from the `pipe-mount` service. Operations may be like these - user mounted an Object storage as a folder and uploaded a file into the mounted folder, user opened the web SSH-terminal and read a file content from one of the Object storages mounted into `~/cloud-data` folder, etc.:  
        ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_13.png)
- `storage lifecycle` - logs related to management events with [storage lifecycle rules](../08_Manage_Data_Storage/8.10._Storage_lifecycle.md#create-transition-rule) (_CREATE_/_EDIT_/_DELETE_ operations for rules), e.g.:  
    ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_14.png)

#### Show service account events

The **Include Service Account Events** checkbox allows to show/hide log message from the service account (main admin user). Since from this account many messages are received, much more than from other users, by default these messages are hidden.
