### Pipe CLI

### Git CLI

Here you can see instructions how to configure your Git client to work with the Cloud Pipeline.

## System events

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

**System events** tab represents system events notifications. Here you can create, edit, delete system events notifications.  
System events notifications are organized into a table. It represents the **body of the notification**, its **severity status** ("_info_", "_warning_" or "_critical_") and **date of creation**, **activity status**.  
**_Note_**: Variants of activity status:

- **Blocking** event emerges in the middle of the window and requires confirmation from the user to disappear.
- **Active** notifications will be shown for all users of the Cloud Pipeline until admin sets them inactive.

Administrator can **edit** and **delete** notifications via corresponding buttons.

## User management

> This tab is visible only for administrator.

The **User management** tab helps to manage user groups and system roles.

To grant or refuse permissions to a specific group of users (e.g. project team members), you can just create a user group and grant or refuse permissions to the specific set of objects to the whole group.  
System roles is one of the principal tool for managing security access to the objects. Even if you have **WRITE** permission for a folder object, you might be not able to create a pipeline there, if you don't have the **ROLE\_PIPELINE\_MANAGER** role.  
**_Note_**: About permissions, you can read more [here](../13_Permissions/13._Permissions.md).

**User management** consists of the 3 following tabs: **Users**, **Groups**, **Roles**.

### Users

This table view displays a list of users and their additional information:

- **Name** - an authenticated domain account (SAML/OAuth/OpenID), e.g. e-mail.
- **Groups** - a set of groups assigned to a user. It could be whether CP's user's groups and groups, given to each user automatically by **SSO authentication system**.  
    **_Note_**: automatically created groups based on SSO authentication system are light-grey colored.
- **Roles** - a set of system roles assigned to a user.
