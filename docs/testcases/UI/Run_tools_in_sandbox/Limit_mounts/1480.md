# Check limit mounts warnings

Test verifies appearing of warnings in case of "out of memory" risk due to the large storage mounts number.

**Prerequisites**:

- admin user
- non-admin user

**Preparations**:

1. Log in as the non-admin user from the prerequisites
2. Open the **Tools** page
3. Select any tool (e.g. _ubuntu_)
4. At the tool page, hover over the "**Run v**" button
5. Click the "**Custom settings**" button in the list
6. Expand the "**Exec environment**" section
7. Click the "**Node type**" dropdown list
8. Find the node type with the smallest integer RAM volume (but bigger than `0`), save that volume count
9. Expand the "**Advanced**" section
10. Click the control near the "**Limit mounts**" label
11. Count the number of the only _object_ non-sensitive storages in the displayed pop-up
12. If the count from step 11 less than the count from step 8:
    - Log out
    - Log in as the admin from the prerequisites
    - Create the storage and give access to it for the non-admin user from the prerequisites
    - Repeat the previous step till the sum of the created storages count and of the number from step 11 will become equal to the number from step 8
    - Log out
