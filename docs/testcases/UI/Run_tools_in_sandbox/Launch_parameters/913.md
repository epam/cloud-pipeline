# Add support for autoscaling filesystem for AWS

Test verifies that for all runs with the file system autoscaling capability being enabled the daemon checks current filesystem usage and attach additional disks in case there is no enough space in the filesystem.

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user

**Preparations**
1. Login as admin user from the prerequisites
2. Open the **Settings** page
3. Click the **PREFERENCES** tab
4. Check that `cluster.instance.hdd.scale.enabled` has enabled value
5. Check that the **`cluster.instance.hdd.scale.delta.ratio`** preference has the value should be specified at deploy (`delta_ratio`) 

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | Login as the admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Tools** page | |
| 3 | Select the test tool | |
| 4 | Click the ***Run with custom settings*** button | |
| 5 | Expand the **Advanced** section | |
| 6 | Select `On-demand` value for **Price type**. Tick _Do not mount storages_ option | |
| 7 | Expand **Exec environment** section | |
| 8 | Input `25` into the **_Disk (Gb)_** field | |
| 9 | Click **Launch** button | |
| 10 | At the Runs page, click the just-launched run | |
| 11 | Wait until the SSH hyperlink appears | |
| 12 | Click the SSH hyperlink | |
| 13 | In the opened tab, enter and perform the command `df -hT` | File system space usage table is shown in the response |
| 14 | Store ***Avail*** and ***Size*** values for filesystem with type `btrfs` | |
| 15 | Enter and perform the command <br> `fallocate -l <file_size>G test.big`, <br> where `<file_size>` is a value equals to the value of ***Avail*** kept at the step 14 minus 1 | 
| 16 | Return to the run log page | |
| 17 | Wait until the ***FilesystemAutoscaling*** task appears | |
| 18 | Click ***FilesystemAutoscaling*** task | Log contains record <br> `Filesystem /ebs was autoscaled <value1>G + <value2>G = <value3>G.`, <br> where <br> `<value1>` is value of ***Size*** kept in the step 14, <br> `<value2>` is `<value1> * delta_ratio`, <br> `<value3> = <value1> + <value2>` |
| 19 | Click the SSH hyperlink. In the opened tab, enter and perform the command `df -hT` | File system space usage table is shown in the response that contains ***Size*** value for filesystem with type `btrfs` equal to the `<value3>` from the step 18 |
| 20 | Return to the run log page | |
| 21 | Click **Commit** link. Enter new version. Click **Commit** button | |
| 22 | Wait until **COMMIT SUCCEEDED** message appears on the run log page | |
| 23 | Click ***FilesystemAutoscaling*** task | Log contains 2 records similar to the record from step 18 with a corresponding the previous disk size increasing by 1.5 times |
| 24 | Click the SSH hyperlink. In the opened tab, enter and perform the command `df -hT` | File system space usage table is shown in the response that contains ***Size*** value for filesystem with type `btrfs` equal to the value from the last log record from the step 23 |
| 25 | Return to the run log page | |
| 26 | Click **PAUSE** button and wait until **PAUSE** button is changed to the **RESUME** button | | | |
| 27 | Click **RESUME** button and wait until **RESUME** button is changed to the **PAUSE** button | |
| 28 | Click ***FilesystemAutoscaling*** task | Log contains record similar to the record from step 18 with a corresponding the previous disk size increasing by 1.5 times |
| 29 | Click the SSH hyperlink. In the opened tab, enter and perform the command `df -hT` | File system space usage table is shown in the response that contains ***Size*** value for filesystem with type `btrfs` equal to the value from the last log record from the step 28 |

**After:**
- Stop the run launched at step 9
- Delete test tool version created at step 21
