The System Logs tab contains the full list of security trail events.

Each record in the logs list contains:

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| **Date** | The date and time of the log event |
| **Log status** | The status of the log message (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.) |
| **Log message** | Description of the log event |
| **User** | User name who performed the event |
| **Service** | Service name that registered the event (`api-srv`, `edge`) |
| **Type** | Log message type (currently, only `security` type is available) |

## Filters

By default, in the list all logs are displayed from new to old.  
For the more convenient search of the desired logs, there are filters over the logs list:

You may combine them in any order for your needs.

### Date filter

To restrict the list of logs for a specific date/time interval - use the **From** and **To** controls.  
For example, to view logs for all events that were today after `21:30`:

- Click the **From** control:  
    ![CP_SystemLogs](attachments/SystemLogs_2.png)  
    Click the **Select time** button
- Select the desired time (the left column for hours, middle - for minutes, right - for secs):

### User filter

### Message filter

To find the log by its event message (or its part) - use the **Message** field. Just click this field, specify the desired text and press the Enter key, e.g.:

#### Hostname filter

To restrict the list of logs for a certain service host(s) - use the **Hostname** control. You may select the desired host from the dropdown list.  
Multi-select is supported.

#### Type filter

To restrict the list of logs for a certain log message type(s) - use the **Type** control. You may select the desired type from the dropdown list.  
**_Note_**: currently, only `security` type is available.

#### Show service account events

The **Include Service Account Events** checkbox allows to show/hide log message from the service account (main admin user). Since from this account many messages are received, much more than from other users, by default these messages are hidden.
