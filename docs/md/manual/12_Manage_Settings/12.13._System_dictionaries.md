## Using dictionaries

We will use the following dictionary:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_17.png)

1. Open the attributes section for the entity you wish to add an attribute (in our example, we will add the attribute for the user).
2. Click the "**+ Add**" button in the "**Attributes**" section:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_18.png)
3. Into the "_Key_" field specify the dictionary name that you wish to use as categorical attribute:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_19.png)  
    **_Note_**: as you start typing into the "_Key_" field, possible dictionaries names will appear in the dropdown list
4. When the existing dictionary name will be specified into the "_Key_" field, the "_Value_" field "transforms" to the dropdown list with the all values of the corresponding dictionary:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_20.png)
5. Any value from the list can be selected. Click the "Add" button to confirm the selection:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_21.png)
6. Added attribute will appear:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_22.png)
7. Later, the attribute value can be edit - in the same way (via the dropdown list with possible dictionary values).
8. Also, the attribute name ("_Key_" field) can be renamed - in the same way as "regular" attributes. If the "_Key_" will be changed to any value that doesn't matches with any existing dictionary - the "_Value_" field will be automatically transform to the plain text field.
9. If at step 5, the value with "links" will be selected, the linked dictionaries and their predefined values, will appear automatically:  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_23.png)  
    ![CP_Dictionaries](attachments/Dictionaries_24.png)

Please note, all functionality described above is available only for admins. "General" users can't view/edit System Dictionaries.  
Also, if non-admin user tries to specify any existing dictionary as the attribute "_Key_" - it will be displayed as plain text attribute. No dictionary values will be loaded/displayed.
