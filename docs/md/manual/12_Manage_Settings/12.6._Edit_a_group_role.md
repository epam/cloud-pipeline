    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_01.png)
4. Pop-up window will be shown:  
    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_02.png)

At this form, there are several blocks of the settings for a group/role.

### Default data storage

![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_03.png)

### User management

In this block, you can change a members list of the opened group/role:  
![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_04.png)

For more information see [12.8. Change a set of roles/groups for a user](12.8._Change_a_set_of_roles_groups_for_a_user.md#change-a-member-list-for-a-selected-role-or-group).

### Attributes

![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_05.png)  
In this block you can set metadata tags (attributes) for a group. These tags represent key/value pairs, same as pipeline/folder tags. For more information see [17. CP objects tagging by additional attributes](../17_Tagging_by_attributes/17._CP_objects_tagging_by_additional_attributes.md).

### Launch options

![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_06.png)

In this block you can specify some restrictions for a group of users/role on allowed instance types and price types.
Here you can specify:

| Field and Description | Example |
|---|---|
| **Allowed instance types mask**<br><br>This mask restricts allowed instance types for launching tools, pipelines and configurations | If you want members of a group/role to be able to launch runs with only "m5..." instances types,<br>mask would be **`m5*`**:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_07.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, pipeline or configuration, dropdown list of available node types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_08.png) |
| **Allowed tool instance types mask**<br><br>This mask restricts allowed instance types only for tools.<br />This mask has higher priority for launching tool than **Allowed instance types mask**.<br />I.e. when both masks are set - for the launching tool, **Allowed tool instance types mask** will be applied. | If you want members of a group/role to be able to launch tools with only "large" "m5..." instances types,<br>mask would be **`m5*.large*`**:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_09.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, dropdown list of available node types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_10.png) |
| **Allowed price types**<br><br>This field may restrict price types are allowed for a group/role. | If you want members of a group/role to be able to launch "On-demand" runs only, select it in the dropdown list:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_11.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, dropdown list of price types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_12.png) |
| **Jobs visibility**<br><br>This field may restrict the visibility of runs on the **Active Runs** page for non-owner users. | If you want users from a group/role to be able to view all pipeline runs (for which users have permissions),<br>select "_Inherit_" in this dropdown list:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_14.png)<br />If you want users from a group/role can view only runs they launched, select "_Only owner_":<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_15.png) |
| **Cloud Credentials Profiles**<br /><br />Here, specific interfaces can be assigned for a group/role.<br />Such interfaces allow to use seamless authentication in _Cloud Provider_ services. | For details and examples see [here](12.11._Advanced_features.md#seamless-authentication-in-cloud-provider). |
| **Default Credentials Profile**<br /><br />Allows to select one of **Cloud Credentials Profiles** assigned to the group/role as the default profile. | For details and examples see [here](12.11._Advanced_features.md#seamless-authentication-in-cloud-provider). |

To apply configured launch options for a group/role, click ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_13.png) button in the right bottom corner of the pop-up. This action will save all made changes in the group/role settings (not only launch options) and close the pop-up.

Setting restrictions on allowed instance types/price types is a convenient way to minimize a number of invalid configurations runs.  
Such restrictions could be set not only for a group/role, but on another levels too.  
In **Cloud Pipeline** platform next hierarchy is set for applying of inputted allowed instance types (sorted by priority):

- **User level** (specified for a user) - see [12.4. Edit/delete a user](12.4._Edit_delete_a_user.md#launch-options) for details
- **User group level** (specified for a group/role). If a user is a member of several groups - list of allowed instances will be summarized across all the groups. See [above](#launch-options) for details
- **Tool level** (specified for a tool) - see [10.5. Launch a Tool](../10_Manage_Tools/10.5._Launch_a_Tool.md#instance-management) for details
- _(global)_ **`cluster.allowed.instance.types.docker`** (specified on "Cluster" tab in "Preferences" section of system-level settings) - see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#cluster) for details
- _(global)_ **`cluster.allowed.instance.types`** (specified on "Cluster" tab in "Preferences" section of system-level settings) - see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#cluster) for details

After specifying allowed instance types, all GUI forms that allow to select the list of instance types (configurations/launch forms) - will display only valid instance type, according to hierarchy above.  
For price type specifying - if it is set for the user/group/tool - GUI will allow to select only that price type.

In **Cloud Pipeline** platform next hierarchy is set for applying of jobs visibility (sorted by priority):

- **User level** - highest priority (specified for a user) - see [12.4. Edit/delete a user](12.4._Edit_delete_a_user.md#launch-options) for details
- **Group level** (specified for a group/role) - see [above](#launch-options) for details
- _(global)_ **`launch.run.visibility`** (specified as global defaults via system-level settings) - see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#launch) for details

### Possibility to revert changes

In certain cases, there could be convenient to undo all changes in a group/role profile when modifying it - without closing the form.

The admin has such ability:

- open the **User management** tab and then the **Groups**/**Roles** tab
- select the desired group to modify, click the **Edit** button to open the popup with the group's settings
- edit some settings
- if needed to revert done changes - click the **REVERT** button at the bottom of the form (**_Note_**: it's possible only before saving!):  
    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_16.png)  
- all done unsaved changes are reverted. The **REVERT** button becomes disabled:  
    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_17.png)

**_Note_**: in such way all unsaved changes of user settings could be reverted - _Default data storage_, _Users_ list, _Attributes_ and _Launch options_.
