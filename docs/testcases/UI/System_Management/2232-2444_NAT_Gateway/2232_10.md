# Add several route records with the same server name but different ports

Test verifies that it's possible to add several route records with the same server name but different ports

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Perform [2232_2](2232_2.md) case
- Test server `<Server_name_4>`.

**Preparations**
1. Open the **Settings** page. Click the **SYSTEM MANAGEMENT** tab
2. Check that route with server name `<Server_name_4>` isn't shown in the routes list.

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Settings** page | |
| 3 | Click the **SYSTEM MANAGEMENT** tab | |
| 4 | Click the **NAT GATEWAY** tab | |
| 5 | Click **Add Route** button | |
| 6 | Input `<Server_name_4>` into the ***Server name:*** field |  |
| 7 | Mark ***Specify IP address*** checkbox | |
| 8 | Input `80` into the ***Port:*** field | |
| 9 | Input `port1` into the ***Comment:*** field | |
| 10 | Click **Add** button | |
| 11 | Repeat steps 5 - 10 with values <li>`443` for the ***Port:*** field <li> `port2` for the ***Comment:*** field | |
| 12 | Click **Save** button | Icons with status ***CREATION SCHEDULED*** appear for records added at steps 10 and 11 |
| 13 | Wait 1 minute and click **Refresh** button | Grouping row for `<Server_name_3>` appears that contains <li> **+** icon near the server name to expand group <li> list of Ports `80, 443` |
| 14 | Click **+** icon near the `<Server_name_3>` name to expand group | The records added at steps 10 and 11 are shown in the group list and have <li> icons with status ***ACTIVE*** <li> the same *Internal IPs*, different *Internal Ports* and *Comments* |
| 15 | Store *Internal IP* for the route saved at step 12 | |
| 16 | At the **Runs** page, click the run launched at step 16 of [2232_2](2232_2.md) case| |
| 17 | Click the **SSH** hyperlink | |
| 18 | In the opened tab, enter and perform the command: <br>`unset http_proxy https_proxy` <br> `curl <Server_name_4>:80 -v -ipv4` | The command output contains: <br> `Trying <internal_ip>...>` <br> `Connected to <Server_name_4> <internal_ip> port 80`, <br> where `<internal_ip>` is *Internal IP* stored at step 15 |
| 19 | In the opened tab, enter and perform the command: <br> `curl <Server_name_4>:443 -v -ipv4` | The command output contains: <br> `Trying <internal_ip>...>` <br> `Connected to <Server_name_4> <internal_ip> port 443`, <br> where `<internal_ip>` is *Internal IP* stored at step 15 |

**After:**
- Delete all routes with server names`<Server_name_1>` - `<Server_name_4>`added at cases [2232_2](2232_2.md) - [2232_10](2232_10.md).
- Stop run launched at step 16 of [2232_2](2232_2.md) case
