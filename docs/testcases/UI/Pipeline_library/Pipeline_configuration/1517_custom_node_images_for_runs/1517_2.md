**Prerequisites**:

- admin user

**Actions**:

1. Perform [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case
2. Open the **Library** page
3. Run the pipeline created at step 4 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case
4. Open the just launched pipeline
5. Click the **Instance** section to expand
6. Open the "**Cluster state**" page
7. Save the node name for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case
8. Wait until the row for the pipeline launched at step 3 appears in the list
9. Click the run ID label in the row for the pipeline launched at step 3
10. Wait until the run will be completed
11. Repeat step 2
12. Run the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case
13. Save the run ID of the just launched pipeline
14. Repeat step 6
15. Wait until the row with the run ID equals to the saved at step 13 appears

**Expected result**:

After step 5, **Instance** section doesn't contain the row `Node image: ...`

After step 6, nodes list contains:

- the row for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case

After step 8, nodes list contains:

- the row for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case
- the row for the pipeline created at step 4 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case

After step 15, nodes list contains the row for the pipeline created at step 3 of the preparations of [_1517\_1_](1517_1.md) case. In this row:

- run ID equals to the saved at step 13
- node name equals to the saved at step 7
