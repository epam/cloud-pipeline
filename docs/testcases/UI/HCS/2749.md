# [Manual] Ability to merge Z-stack in a single projection

Test verifies
- that User has ability to merge several Z-planes of the same HCS image (in each field) in a single image (intensity projection)

**Prerequisites**:
- User that has full permissions to the storage with HCS images
- HCS image with several Z-planes

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Library** page | |
| 3 | Find HCS image from the Prerequisites | |
| 4 | Click the **HCS** icon near the HCS image file name | ***Preview pop-up*** opens that contains <li> All available image Z-planes are shown in the *Z-planes* section: <ul><li> first Z-plane is selected by default <li> *Select all* link is shown |
| 5 | Click **Analysis** icon on the *Preview panel* | |
| 6 | Select any field on the *Well panel* | |
| 7 | Click *Select all* link | Z-planes panel: <li> All z-planes are selected <li> *Use planes projection* checkbox appears <li> *Select all* link disappears </li> Analysis panel: <li> Message `Selection: 1 well, 1 field, 1 time point, <n> z-planes. Analysis will be submitted as a batch job that can be found at Evaluations tab. For fine-tuning pipeline select a single well, field, and time point.` is shown on the Analysis panel |
| 8 | Tick *Use planes projection* checkbox | Message about batch job disappears from Analysis panel |
| 9 | Holding Shift key, click 2nd z-plane | <li> 2nd z-plane is unselected <li> *Select all* link appears |
| 10 | Click **+ Add module** button on the Analysis panel | |
| 11 | Hover over *Main* section. Select *FindNuclei* option | |
| 12 | Click **+ Output property** in the ***Define Results*** section. Select Object *Nuclei* | |
| 13 | Click **Run Analysis** button | Single analysis starts |
| 14 | Wait until *Analysis done* message appears | *Analysis results* table appears that contains `Projection 1-3-...` in the ***Plane*** column |
| 15 | Untick *Use planes projection* checkbox | |
| 16 | Click **Run Analysis** button | <li> Batch analysis starts <li> *Evaluations* tab opens |
| 17 | Wait until *Analysis results* table appears | *Analysis results* table contains separate row for each z-plane. Z-plane number is shown in the ***Plane*** column |
