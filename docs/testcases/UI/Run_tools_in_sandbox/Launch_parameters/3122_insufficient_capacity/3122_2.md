Test verifies that restart jobs in other regions shouldn't work for cluster run.

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Perform [3122_1](3122_1.md) case
- Node type `type1` of rare compute instance type for the current Cloud Provider which launch attempt can lead to the exception of insufficient capacity of such node types for the Cloud Region
