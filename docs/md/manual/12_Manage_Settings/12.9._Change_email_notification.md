## Configure automatic email notifications on users' runs

Here, the mechanism of automatic email notifications for **_IDLE_** and **_HIGH-CONSUMED_** runs will be described.

### IDLE runs

The system behavior for the **_IDLE_** runs is defined by the set of the following parameters:

| Setting | Preference-duplicate | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **Max duration of idle** (min) | **`system.max.idle.timeout.minutes`** | Specifies the duration in minutes after that the system should check node's activity. If after this duration node's CPU utilization will be below **CPU idle threshold** - email notification **`IDLE_RUN`** will be sent to the user and the run itself will be marked by ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_01.png) label |
| **Action delay** (min) | **`system.idle.action.timeout.minutes`** | Specifies the duration in minutes. If node's CPU utilization is still below **CPU idle threshold** for this duration after the **Max duration of idle** is over - an action, specified in **Action** field will be performed |
| **CPU idle threshold** (%) | **`system.idle.cpu.threshold`** | Specifies percentage of the node's CPU utilization, below which an **Action** shall be taken |
| **Action** | **`system.idle.action`**	| Sets which action to perform with the node, that has the CPU utilization below than **CPU idle threshold**:<br /><ul><li>_NOTIFY_ - only send email notification **`IDLE_RUN`**. This action will be repeated every **Resend delay** if the node's CPU utilization will be still below than **CPU idle threshold**</li><li>_PAUSE_ - pause an instance if possible (only if the instance is `On-Demand`, `Spot` instances are skipped) and send single email notification **`IDLE_RUN_PAUSED`**</li><li>_PAUSE\_OR\_STOP_ - pause an instance if it is `On-Demand` or stop an instance if it is `Spot` and send the corresponding single email notification **`IDLE_RUN_PAUSED`** / **`IDLE_RUN_STOPPED`**</li><li>_STOP_ - Stop an instance, disregarding price-type, and send single email notification **`IDLE_RUN_STOPPED`**</li></ul> |
| **Resend delay** (sec)<br />Only for **`IDLE_RUN`** notification | | Specifies the duration in seconds. Defines a delay after which the **`IDLE_RUN`** notification will be sent repeatedly in case when node's CPU utilization is still below **CPU idle threshold**. **`IDLE_RUN`** notifications will be repeated until **Action delay** is over. Then **Action** will be performed.<br />**_Note_**: if **Action** is set as _NOTIFY_ - sending notifications will be continued every **Resend delay**.<br />**Default value**: `-1`. In that case, **`IDLE_RUN`** notifications will not be resending. |
| | **`system.resource.monitoring.period`** | Specifies period (in milliseconds) between the scannings of running instances to collect the monitoring metrics. After each such period, it's defined to display ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_01.png) label for the specific instance or not |

Described parameters are configured in "common" panel for all **_IDLE_** notifications - **`IDLE_RUN`**, **`IDLE_RUN_PAUSED`**, **`IDLE_RUN_STOP`**, e.g.:  
    ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_02.png)

Saving of the changes in described parameters values at the **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS** form automatically changes the corresponding values in **PREFERENCES**, and vice versa.

### Notifications for long paused runs

There are two notification types for the runs that are in the **_PAUSED_** state for a long time:

**`LONG_PAUSED`** - this notification will be sent if the run has been paused for a long time.  
**`LONG_PAUSED_STOPPED`** - this notification will be sent if the run has been paused for a long time and should be terminated.

The system behavior for the "long paused" runs is defined by the set of the following parameters:

| Setting | Preference-duplicate | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **Action**<br />_Common setting for both notification types_ | **`system.long.paused.action`** | Sets which action to perform with the node, that has been paused for a long time:<br /><ul><li>_NOTIFY_ - only send email notification **`LONG_PAUSED`**. Then this action will be repeated every **Resend delay** if the run will be still paused</li><li>_STOP_ - terminate the paused run and send single email notification **`LONG_PAUSED_STOPPED`**</li></ul> |
| **Threshold** (sec)<br />_Separately sets for each notification type_ | | Specifies the duration in seconds. Defines the delay after which an action, specified in **Action** field, will be performed and the corresponding notification will be sent if the run is still paused. |
| **Resend delay** (sec)<br />Only for **`LONG_PAUSED`** notification type | | Specifies the duration in seconds. Defines a delay after which the **`LONG_PAUSED`** notification will be sent repeatedly in case when the run is still paused after a **Threshold** duration.<br />**_Note_**: if **Action** is set as _NOTIFY_ - sending notifications will be continued every **Resend delay**.<br />**Default value**: `-1`. In that case, **`LONG_PAUSED`** notifications will not be resending. |

Saving of the changes in described parameter value (for **Action**) at the **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS** form automatically changes the corresponding value in **PREFERENCES**, and vice versa.

For example, **`LONG_PAUSED`** notification settings:

### Example of the scenario for automatic notifications for "idle" runs

In general, the system behavior is the following:

1. User launches a run
2. After **Max duration of idle** (**`system.max.idle.timeout.minutes`**) period, the system starts to check the node's activity. Then, the state of the node is checked every **`system.resource.monitoring.period`**
3. If the node's CPU utilization becomes below the **CPU idle threshold** (**`system.idle.cpu.threshold`**):
    - email notification **`IDLE_RUN`** is being sent, the run itself is being marked by the ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_01.png) label
4. **`IDLE_RUN`** notification is being repeated every **Resend delay** (configured for **`IDLE_RUN`**) until the **Action delay** (**`system.idle.action.timeout.minutes`**) period is over.
5. After **Action delay** (**`system.idle.action.timeout.minutes`**), if the node's CPU utilization is still below **CPU idle threshold** (**`system.idle.cpu.threshold`**):
    - email notification **`IDLE_RUN`** is being sent (in case when **Action** (**`system.idle.action`**) is set as _NOTIFY_)
    - run is being paused/stopped and the corresponding email notification **`IDLE_RUN_PAUSED`** or **`IDLE_RUN_STOPPED`** is being sent (in case when **Action** (**`system.idle.action`**) is set as _PAUSE_ / _PAUSE\_OR\_STOP_ / _STOP_)
6. In case when **Action** (**`system.idle.action`**) is set as _NOTIFY_, email notifications **`IDLE_RUN`** continue to be sent every **Resend delay**, if the node's CPU utilization remains below the **CPU idle threshold** (**`system.idle.cpu.threshold`**).
7. In case when run has been paused:
    - if the **Action** (for Long Paused notifications - **`system.long.paused.action`**) is set as _NOTIFY_, and the run has been paused for a **Threshold** period (configured for **`LONG_PAUSED`**), the notification **`LONG_PAUSED`** is being sent.
        - and if **Resend delay** (for **`LONG_PAUSED`**) is configured, then email notifications **`LONG_PAUSED`** continue to be sent every **Resend delay**, if the run is still paused
    - if the **Action** (for Long Paused notifications - **`system.long.paused.action`**) is set as _STOP_, and the run has been paused for a **Threshold** period (configured for **`LONG_PAUSED_STOPPED`**), run is being stopped (terminated) and the corresponding email notification **`LONG_PAUSED_STOPPED`** is being sent.

**_Note_**: users can manually disable the automatic pausing of on-demand instances if they aren't used. For that the "**Auto pause**" checkbox at the Launch page shall be unchecked before the run:  
    ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_04.png)  
This action cancels only the auto pause, but the **`RUN_IDLE`** email notifications will be being sent (if the corresponding conditions will be met).

### HIGH-CONSUMED runs

All settings that configure actions/notifications for "high-consumed" runs are moved to the **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS** section. These settings duplicate some System Preferences and also can be configured from the **PREFERENCES** section, but it is more comfortable to configure them from the **NOTIFICATIONS**.

**`HIGH_CONSUMED_RESOURCES`** notification settings:  
    ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_05.png)

The system behavior for the "high-consumed" runs is defined by the set of the following System-level parameters (Preferences):

| Setting | Preference name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **Threshold of disk consumption** (%) | **`system.disk.consume.threshold`** | Specifies the node's disk threshold (in %) above which the email notification **`HIGH_CONSUMED_RESOURCES`** will be sent and the corresponding run will be marked by ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_06.png) label |
| **Threshold of memory consumption** (%) | **`system.memory.consume.threshold`** | Specifies the node's memory threshold (in %) above which the email notification **`HIGH_CONSUMED_RESOURCES`** will be sent and the corresponding run will be marked by the ![CP_ChangeEmailNotification](attachments/AutomaticNotifications_06.png) label |
| **`system.monitoring.time.range`** | | Specifies the threshold timeout (if a real average resource consumption is higher then any of the thresholds above for that timeout - a notification shall be sent). Also defines the period after which the notification will be sent again, if the problem is still in place |

So, when memory or disk consuming will be higher than a threshold value for a specified period of time (in average) - a notification will be sent (and resent after a delay, if the problem is still in place).

Saving of the changes in described parameters values at the **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS** form automatically changes the corresponding values in **PREFERENCES**, and vice versa.
