- run tries to restart in another region in case of InsufficientInstanceCapacity occurs for on-demand instances
- current run is stopped when new run is started

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Node type `type1` of rare compute instance type for the current Cloud Provider which launch attempt can lead to the exception of insufficient capacity of such node types for the Cloud Region

**Preparations**
