![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_04.png)

For more information see [12.8. Change a set of roles/groups for a user](12.8._Change_a_set_of_roles_groups_for_a_user.md#change-a-member-list-for-a-selected-role-or-group).

### Attributes

![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_05.png)  
In this block you can set metadata tags (attributes) for a group. These tags represent key/value pairs, same as pipeline/folder tags. For more information see [17. CP objects tagging by additional attributes](../17_Tagging_by_attributes/17._CP_objects_tagging_by_additional_attributes.md).

### Launch options

![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_06.png)

In this block you can specify some restrictions for a group of users/role on allowed instance types and price types.
Here you can specify:

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Allowed instance types mask** | This mask restrict for a specific group/role allowed instance types for launching tools, pipelines and configurations | If you want members of a certain group/role will be able to launch runs with only "m5..." instances types, mask would be **`m5*`**:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_07.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, pipeline or configuration, dropdown list of available node types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_08.png) |
| **Allowed tool instance types mask** | This mask restrict for a specific group/role allowed instance types only for tools - launching from tools menu or main dashboard. This mask has higher priority for launching tool than **Allowed instance types mask**. It's meaning that in case when both masks are set - for the launching tool will be applied **Allowed tool instance types mask**. | If you want members of a certain group/role will be able to launch tools with only some of "large" "m5..." instances types, mask would be **`m5*.large*`**:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_09.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, dropdown list of available node types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_10.png) |
| **Allowed price types** | In this field you may restrict, what price types will be allowed for a group/role. | If you want members of a certain group/role will be able to launch "On-demand" runs only, select it in the dropdown list:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_11.png)<br />In that case, before launching tool, dropdown list of price types will be look like this:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_12.png) |
| **Jobs visibility** | In this field you may restrict the visibility of running jobs on the **Active Runs** page for non-owner users. | If you want users from that group (role) will be able to view all pipeline runs (for that pipelines on which users have corresponding permissions), select "Inherit" in this dropdown list:<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_14.png)<br />If you want users from that group (role) can view only runs they launched, select "Only owner":<br />![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_15.png) |

To apply set restrictions for a group/role click ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_13.png) button.

Setting restrictions on allowed instance types/price types is a convenient way to minimize a number of invalid configurations runs.  
Such restrictions could be set not only for a group/role, but on another levels too.  
In CP platform next hierarchy is set for applying of inputted allowed instance types (sorted by priority):

- User level (specified for a user on "User management" tab) (see [12.4. Edit/delete a user](12.4._Edit_delete_a_user.md#launch-options))
- User group level (specified for a group (role) on "User management" tab. If a user is a member of several groups - list of allowed instances will be summarized across all the groups) (see [above](#launch-options))
- Tool level (specified for a tool on "Instance management" panel) (see [10.5. Launch a Tool](../10_Manage_Tools/10.5._Launch_a_Tool.md#instance-management))
- _(global)_ **`cluster.allowed.instance.types.docker`** (specified on "Cluster" tab in "Preferences" section of system-level settings) (see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#cluster))
- _(global)_ **`cluster.allowed.instance.types`** (specified on "Cluster" tab in "Preferences" section of system-level settings) (see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#cluster))

After specifying allowed instance types, all GUI forms that allow to select the list of instance types (configurations/launch forms) - will display only valid instance type, according to hierarchy above.  
For price type specifying - if it is set for the user/group/tool - GUI will allow to select only that price type.

In CP platform next hierarchy is set for applying of jobs visibility (sorted by priority):

- User level - highest priority (specified for a user) (see [12.4. Edit/delete a user](12.4._Edit_delete_a_user.md#launch-options))
- Group level (specified for a group/role) (see [above](#launch-options))
- _(global)_ **`launch.run.visibility`** (specified as global defaults via system-level settings) (see [12.10. Manage system-level settings](12.10._Manage_system-level_settings.md#launch))

### Possibility to revert changes

In certain cases, there could be convenient to undo all changes in a group/role profile when modifying it - without closing the form.

The admin has such ability:

- open the **User management** tab and then the **Groups**/**Roles** tab
- select the desired group to modify, click the **Edit** button to open the popup with the group's settings
- edit some settings
- if needed to revert done changes - click the **REVERT** button at the bottom of the form (**_Note_**: it's possible only before saving!):  
    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_16.png)  
- all done unsaved changes are reverted. The **REVERT** button becomes disabled:  
    ![CP_EditGroupRole](attachments/EditGroupRole_17.png)

**_Note_**: in such way all unsaved changes of user settings could be reverted - _Default data storage_, _Users_ list, _Attributes_ and _Launch options_.
