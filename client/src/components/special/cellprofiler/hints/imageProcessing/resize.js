__Resize__ resizes images (changes their resolution).

This module is compatible with 2D and 3D/volumetric images; for 3D images the module resizes only in X and Y, not in Z.

Images are resized (made smaller or larger) based on your input. You can resize an image by applying a resizing factor or by specifying the desired dimensions, in pixels. You can also select which interpolation method to use.

Supports 2D? YES

Supports 3D? YES
