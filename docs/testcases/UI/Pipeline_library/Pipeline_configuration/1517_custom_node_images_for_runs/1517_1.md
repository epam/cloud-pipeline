# Check custom node image for the pipeline run

Test verifies that cloud instance with the custom node image has to be instantiated if custom node image is specified for pipeline

**Prerequisites**:

- admin user

**Preparations**:

1. Login as admin user from the prerequisites
2. Open the **Library** page
3. Create the pipeline from the **DEFAULT** template
4. Repeat step 3
5. Open the pipeline created at step 3
6. Click the pipeline version
7. Click the **CONFIGURATION** tab
8. Expand the "**Exec environment**" section
9. Save the "**Cloud Region**" value
10. Open the "**System Settings**" page
11. Click the **PREFERENCES** tab
12. Find the preference **`cluster.networks.config`**
13. In the value of this preference, find the block of the region in `regions` array with `name` equals to the name saved at step 9
14. In the found region block, find the block of the ami in `amis` array with `instance_mask` equals `*`. Save the `ami` value
15. In the found region block, find any block of the ami in `amis` array with `instance_mask` not equals `*`. Save the `ami` value (_**note**: it should distinct from the saved at step 14_)
