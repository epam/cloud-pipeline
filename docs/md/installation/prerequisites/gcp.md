# GCP 

**Note**: Account specific information shall be updated according to the environment:

* Project ID: `<project-id>`
* Region: `<region-id>`

## VPC

A new VPC in the `<project-id>` project with the default configuration

## Subnets

* A routable subnet with /26 CIDR or a subnet with the Public IPs allowed. It will be used to deploy user-facing services
* Non routable subnets(s) with any private CIDR range (e.g. /16) in the <region-id>. These subnets will be used to launch the worker nodes

```
Note: for small deployments or POCs - a single small routable subnet is enough
```
