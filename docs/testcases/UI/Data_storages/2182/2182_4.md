# READ ONLY Quota verification

Test verifies that at transition between the storage states MOUNT DISABLED → READ ONLY:
- In active jobs filesystem mount becomes read-only and a user can't perform any modification
- In new jobs filesystem is mounted as read-only by default
- On GUI: <ul><li> Storage becomes read-only. User shall raise a support ticket to cleanup the filesystem <li> "Warning" icon is displayed. It shows "READ ONLY" state </ul>

**Prerequisites**:

- admin user
- non-admin user
- Perform [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as admin user from Prerequisites | |
| 2 | At the Runs page, click the run launched at step 7 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case Preparations | |
| 3 | Click the SSH hyperlink | |
| 4 | Execute command: <br> `head -c 1000MB /dev/urandom > /cloud-data/<storage_name with path>/test2.big`, <br>where `<storage_name with path>` is the full path to the storage created at step 3 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case  Preparations | |
| 5 | Open the **Library** page | |
| 6 | Open the storage created at step 3 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case  Preparations | Storage page opens and contains: <li> Storage size is 2.5 Gb <li> ***Warning*** icon is displayed. <li> *Storage status is: MOUNT IS READ-ONLY* is shown on the ***Warning*** icon tooltip <li> **Create** and **Upload** buttons are shown |
| 7 | At the Runs page, click the run launched at step 7 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case Preparations | |
| 8 | Click the SSH hyperlink | |
| 9 | Execute command: <br> `echo test file >> cloud-data/<storage_name with path>/test_file1.txt`, <br>where `<storage_name with path>` is the full path to the storage created at step 3 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) case  Preparations | `test_file1.txt` file is created |
| 10 | Login as non-admin user from Prerequisites | |
| 11 | Repeat steps 5-6 | Storage page opens and contains: <li> Storage size is increased by 1 Gb <li> ***Warning*** icon is displayed. <li> *Storage status is: MOUNT IS READ-ONLY* is shown on the ***Warning*** icon tooltip <li> **Create** and **Upload** buttons aren't shown |
| 12 | At the Runs page, click the run launched at step 2 of [_2182\_3_](2182_3.md) | |
| 13 | Repeat steps 8-9 (with `test_file2.txt` file name) | <li> `test_file2.txt` file isn't created <li> Response `Read-only file system` is shown |
| 14 | Open the Tools page | |
| 15 | Select test tool | |
| 16 | Launch a tool with default settings | |
| 17 | At the Runs page, click the just-launched run | |
| 18 | Wait until the SSH hyperlink appears | |
| 19 | Repeat 8-9 steps (with `test_file2.txt` file name) | <li> `test_file2.txt` file isn't created <li> Response `Read-only file system` is shown |

**After**:
- Remove `test_file1.txt` file created at step 9
