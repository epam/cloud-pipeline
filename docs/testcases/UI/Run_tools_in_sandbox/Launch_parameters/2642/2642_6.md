# Check running instances restriction for launch tool with configured Cluster

Test verifies that the restriction of the running instances count works correctly for case of Auto-Scaled Cluster runs

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Non-admin user
- Perform [2642_5](2642_5.md) case

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the admin user from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Tools** page | |
| 3 | Select the test tool | |

| 5 | Expand the **Execution environment** section | |
| 6 | Click the **Configure cluster** control | |
| 7 | Click the **Cluster** tab | |
| 8 | Set value `2` into ***Child nodes:*** field | |

| 12 | Open the **Tools** page | |
| 13 | Select the test tool | |
| 14 | Launch a tool with default settings | **Launch** pop-up that contains error message `You have exceeded maximum number of running jobs (3).` appears |
| 15 | Click **Launch** button | Error message `Launch of new jobs is restricted as [<non-admin user>] user will exceed [<user-contextual-limit>] runs limit [3]` appears, where <br> `<non-admin user>` is the non-admin user from the prerequisites, <br> `3` is the value specified at step 6 of the Preparations of the [2642_5](2642_5.md) case |

**After:**
- Stop runs launched at steps 4, 17 of [2642_5](2642_5.md) case
- Remove cluster option configured for the test tool at steps 8-10
