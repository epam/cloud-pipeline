# Check restricted only to specific users groups "system" parameters via CLI

Test verifies that 
- If the user launches a job with a parameter, which is not allowed - a meaningful error shall be thrown and job shall NOT be started


**Prerequisites**:
- User group (*User_group*)
- Non-admin user isn't added to the *User_group* (*User1*)
- Perform [2342_1](2342_1.md) case

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login as the non-admin *User1* from the prerequisites | |
| 2 | Open the **Tools** page | |
| 3 | Select the test tool | |
| 4 | Launch a tool with default settings | |
| 5 | At the **Runs** page, click the just-launched run | | 
| 6 | Wait until the **SSH** hyperlink appears | |
| 7 | Click the **SSH** hyperlink | |
| 8 | In the opened tab, enter and perform the command: `pipe run -di <docker image> --CP_FSBROWSER_ENABLED true`, <br> where `<docker image>` is the test tool name with path | <li> job isn't started <li>  The command output is `An error has occurred while starting a job: "CP_FSBROWSER_ENABLED" parameter is not permitted for use`|

**After:**
- `CP_FSBROWSER_ENABLED` parameter from the `launch.system.parameters` system preference should be returned to the view as it was before the [2342_1](2342_1.md) case
