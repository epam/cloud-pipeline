# Restart jobs in other regions shouldn't work if Allow reschedule option is disabled

Test verifies that restart jobs in other regions shouldn't work if _Allow reschedule to different region in case of insufficient capacity_ option for tool is disabled.

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user
- Perform [3122_1](3122_1.md) case
- Node type `type1` of rare compute instance type for the current Cloud Provider which launch attempt can lead to the exception of insufficient capacity of such node types for the Cloud Region

**Preparations**
1. Login as admin user from the prerequisites
2. Open the **Settings** page
3. Click the **PREFERENCES** tab
4. Find the **`run.reschedule.enabled`** preference
5. Check *Enabled* checkbox for `run.reschedule.enabled` preference if needed
6. Click **Save** button if needed

**After:**
- Restore the value of the option _Allow reschedule to different region in case of insufficient capacity_ that was in place before step 6
- Restore the value of the `run.reschedule.enabled` preference to the previous value saved at step 12 of the preparations of [3122_1](3122_1.md) case
