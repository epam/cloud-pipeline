/**
 * Describes a rule defines lifecycle of objects in a cloud:

 *   - Which directories to search for a files. {@code pathGlob}
 *   - What files. {@code objectGlob}
 *   - When files should be transferred. See {@link StorageLifecycleRuleTransition}
 *          and {@link StorageLifecycleRuleProlongation}
 *   - Where files should be transferred. See {@link StorageLifecycleRuleTransition}
 *   - How files should be transferred. See {@link StorageLifecycleTransitionMethod}

 * Also {@code notification} could be configured to notify user that this rule is going to be applied and prolong
 * if needed.


 * Example 1:
 * We have a rule:
 *     {
 *        "pathGlob": "/data/",
 *        "objectGlob": "*.csv",
 *        "transitionMethod": "LATEST_FILE",
 *        "transitions": [
 *             {
 *                 "transitionAfterDays": 10,
 *                 "storageClass": Glacier
 *             }
 *        ]
 *     }

 * For such rule we will move all csv files from directory /data/ only when latest file will have an age of 10 days.


 * Example 2:
 * If {@code glob} is provided, eligibility for transitions files matches {@link StorageLifecycleRule} should
 * be checked based on files that match this glob, instead of objectGlob from {@link StorageLifecycleRule}

 * This value will be resolved against path for which {@link StorageLifecycleRule} is applied.

 * We have a rule:
 *     {
 *        "pathGlob": "/data/",
 *        "objectGlob": "*.csv",
 *        "transitionMethod": "LATEST_FILE",
 *        "transitionCriterion": {
 *            "type": "MATCHING_FILES",
 *            "value": "*.pdf",
 *        },
 *        "transitions": [
 *             {
 *                 "transitionAfterDays": 10,
 *                 "storageClass": Glacier
 *             }
 *        ]
 *     }

 * For such rule we will move all csv files from directory /data/ only when in this directory will be located
 * pdf files and latest one will have an age of 10 days.

 * This solves a case when we need to transit one file type depending on condition of another file type
 * (f.e. when we generate one files from another and want to transit after successful generation)

 * For AWS see useful information about some limitation on lifecycle policies:
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html
