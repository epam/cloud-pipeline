Basic `Orchest` development environment Orchest Web GUI

Orchest is a web based tool for creating data science pipelines. Under the hood Orchest runs a collection of containers to provide a scalable platform that can run on your laptop as well as on a large scale cloud cluster.

Orchest lets you:

- Visually construct pipelines. 
- Write code using JupyterLab.
- Write code using any other editor of choice.
- Run any subset of a pipeline.
- Skip certain cells when executing a notebook top-to-bottom.
- Parametrize your data science pipelines to experiment with different modeling ideas.
- Integrate commonly used data-sources.
- Easily define your custom runtime environment.
- Version your pipelines through Git.
